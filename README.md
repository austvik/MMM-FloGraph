# MMM-FloGraph

This is a module for [Magic Mirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) that will collect data from Kartverket in Norway and display a tide table.

The module can be configured to show several days and a spesific location.

The module uses XML data format from Kartverket in Norway.
Please see [Kartverket](http://api.sehavniva.no/tideapi_no.html) for details.
